==Lens calculation form.==

√ for front toric, need one more check: 
  must also have axis between 31 and 149 
...otherwise, it's a single lens


for back toric, before we convert base curves to mm ...
  - need at least 1.25 diopters difference between base curves. 
  ??? - 2nd base curve needs to be .75 diopters less than or equal to steep K reading
...otherwise don't show back toric



√ power fields: round to nearest 1/8.

√ **** fix js error when someone types 6.125 into first power field


cylinder power must be < 0. 
Otherwise: 
√ 1. first power becomes first power + cylinder power. 
√ 2. cylinder power == -cylinder power
√ 3. axis = axis <=90 ? axis + 90 : axis -90;
 
 
√ ** on calculate, show prettified/adjusted values next to each field
√  - k readings, powers need to have two decimal places.
  
  
==THINSITE==

Same 5 inputs.
start with same design/rules for single lens


sam: steeper add minus
fap: flatter add plus

base curve needs to be rounded to nearest .05 increment


order - 1. transpose, 2. vertex, 3. power

example:
first k: 39
second k: 40
first power: -3 -> -1
secondpower: +2 -> -2
axis: 90 -> 180

  output:
    diameter: 10
    basecurve: 38.75
    power: ??
    

==RENOVATION==

New field: "Add Power"


start with same design/rules for single lens
no optical zone output.
